# 🎵 MP3 Splitter (FFmpeg.wasm)

This project is a **100% client-side MP3 splitter** that allows you to split a large MP3 file into multiple tracks using timestamps.

All processing happens **locally in the browser** using FFmpeg.wasm.
No files are uploaded to any server.

---
## ✨ Features

- Split MP3 files by timestamps
- Automatic ZIP generation
- Multi-language UI (auto-detect browser language)
- Runs fully in the browser
- Docker & Nginx ready
- No backend required

---

## 🧭 Track Format

Each track must be written on a new line using the following format:

```
MM:SS - Track Name - Author Name
```

### Example:

```
00:01 - Track One - Author Name
03:10 - Track Two - Author Name
06:22 - Track Three - Author Name
````

The start time defines where the track begins.
The end time is calculated automatically based on the next track.
